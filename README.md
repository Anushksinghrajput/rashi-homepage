This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Run locally

**Do not use Live Server or open the folder on port 5500** — that shows a file listing, not the app. Use the Next.js dev server:

1. In the project folder run: `npm run dev`
2. Note the URL in the terminal (e.g. `Local: http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`)
3. **Open that URL in your browser** to view the Rashi homepage.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
